### Core System Architecture

**Frontend Architecture:**
- Next.js 15 with App Router and React 19
- PIXI.js for high-performance 2D particle rendering via `CanvasStage` component
- Audio engine using HTML5 Audio API with gain controls
- Tailwind CSS with consistent dark theme (bg-gray-950) and path alias `@/*` pointing to `./src/*`

**Multi-User System:**
- NextAuth.js with Google OAuth and email/password authentication
- User-owned soundboards with CRUD operations
- Role-based permissions (USER, ARTIST, ADMIN)
- Public/private visibility controls
- Shareable links for all soundboards (private = hidden from explore only)

**Database Schema (Updated):**
```prisma
User {
  id, email, name, password, role
  soundboards Soundboard[]
}

Soundboard {
  id, name, description, isPublic(default: true), userId
  globalScale, plays, likes, slug
  zones Zone[]
}

Zone {
  id, position(1-16), soundboardId
  animationKey, animationCfg, isActive
  samples Sample[]
}

Sample {
  id, zoneId, url, volume, name
}
```

**URL Structure:**
- `/` - Default landing/main soundboard experience
- `/auth/signin` & `/auth/signup` - Authentication pages
- `/dashboard` - Personal soundboard management
- `/explore` - Public soundboard discovery
- `/play/[id]` - Specific soundboard playback
- `/soundboard/new` - Create new soundboard
- `/soundboard/[id]/edit` - Edit soundboard (owner only)

### Key Features Implemented

- Mobile UI tested and optimized for responsiveness
- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- Build process verified for production deployment

**Current Production Status:**
- Multi-user platform fully functional

- **Audio upload system working correctly** - all 405 errors resolved
- Mobile responsive design implemented
- All critical features tested and operational
- Soundboard editing (upload, delete, modify) working for authenticated users

### Development Patterns

**File Structure:**
- API routes follow RESTful patterns in `src/app/api/`
- Page components in `src/app/` with route groups
- Reusable components in `src/components/`
- Business logic in `src/lib/` with domain-specific subdirectories

**Authentication Flow:**
- NextAuth.js handles all authentication
- Middleware protects private routes
- Session context available throughout app

**Data Flow:**
- Client interactions â†’ API routes â†’ Prisma â†’ database updates
- Real-time updates via optimistic UI patterns
- File uploads â†’ Vercel Blob â†’ database URL storage

**TypeScript Standards:**
- Strict typing with explicit types for all variables
- Proper interface definitions for API responses
- Type-safe database operations with Prisma
