- Audio engine using HTML5 Audio API with gain controls
- Tailwind CSS with consistent dark theme (bg-gray-950) and path alias `@/*` pointing to `./src/*`

**Multi-User System:**
- NextAuth.js with Google OAuth and email/password authentication
- User-owned soundboards with CRUD operations
- Role-based permissions (USER, ARTIST, ADMIN)
- Public/private visibility controls
- Shareable links for all soundboards (private = hidden from explore only)

**Database Schema (Updated):**
```prisma
User {
  id, email, name, password, role
  soundboards Soundboard[]
}

Soundboard {
  id, name, description, isPublic(default: true), userId
  globalScale, plays, likes, slug
  zones Zone[]
}

Zone {
  id, position(1-16), soundboardId
  animationKey, animationCfg, isActive
  samples Sample[]
}

Sample {
  id, zoneId, url, volume, name
}
```

**URL Structure:**
- `/` - Default landing/main soundboard experience
- `/auth/signin` & `/auth/signup` - Authentication pages
